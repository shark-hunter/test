      <h3>ACT 1</h3>

      <h3>PROLOGUE</h3>
      
      <pre>
        
In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;
Whose misadventured piteous overthrows
Do with their death bury their parents' strife.
The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,
And the continuance of their parents' rage,
Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,
Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;
The which if you with patient ears attend,
What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.
      </pre>
      <h3>SCENE I. Verona. A public place.</h3>
      
      <p>
        Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords and bucklers
      </p>
      <h3>SAMPSON</h3>
      
      <p>
        Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.
      </p>
      <h3>GREGORY</h3>
      
      <p>
        No, for then we should be colliers.
